**sobel** - a program which applies Sobel convolution operator to images.

Usage: *./sobel* *file\_name* *num\_of_threads*

Output file will be in the same directory with *_sobel* suffix in the name.

"stb" - library for working with images using C language - can be downloaded here: https://github.com/nothings/stb.git. I made no changes in it, so it will work properly.
